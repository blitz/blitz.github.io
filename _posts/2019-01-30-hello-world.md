After spending something like 10 years writing system software for Intel x86
processors, it is time to share some of the horrors.

If you are excited about discovering x86 features that are long forgotten (for
good reason!), then you have come to the right place. Subscribe to the
[feed][feed] or follow [me][twitter] on Twitter to get notified of posts.

If you have a suggestion of a legacy feature we should blog about, feel free to
[open an issue][newissue].
