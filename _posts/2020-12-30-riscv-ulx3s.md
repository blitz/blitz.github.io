This post is part of a series about operating system development. In
my [previous
post](/generic/2020/10/30/complexity-in-operating-systems.html)
I talked about what kind of operating system I'm personally aiming
for. In this post I'm describing my development setup. Specifically, I
want to write about why I chose my current setup and how the
development workflow works. I hope this is useful for anyone starting
out with operating system development.

## RISC-V

When I started out with my current project, I had to decide what
[Instruction Set Architecture
(ISA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) to
target. Credible choices these days are
[x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86),
[ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) and
[RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V).  All three offer all
the features to build a modern OS with virtual memory and preemptive
scheduling. So from that point they are equivalent, but there are
large differences in the complexity and frustration you will
encounter.

I've written about the differences of x86 vs RISC-V complexity in my
[RISC-V Stumbling
Blocks](/generic/2020/01/01/riscv-intro.html) blog
post. Long story short: **Everything is simpler on RISC-V** compared
to x86. Seasoned x86 veterans may enjoy the [Page Fault Weird
Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFGwZA_4URg) as a case in
point. Given that my goal is to stay as low complexity as possible,
the choice was easy.

ARM falls somewhat in the middle between x86 and RISC-V for me and I
don't see a good reason to choose it over RISC-V, especially when
starting out from scratch. Even if I eventually want to support ARM,
it's probably easier to get everything going with RISC-V and port
later.

## ULX3S

Since I wrote about [RISC-V Stumbling
Blocks](/generic/2020/01/01/riscv-intro.html), the hardware
availability situation has notably improved. The different emulators
are not the only choice for development anymore.

A PC-class development board, the [HiFive
Unmatched](https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-unmatched), has been
released in 2020. It sells for around 500€. I went a bit smaller and
chose the [ULX3S](https://www.crowdsupply.com/radiona/ulx3s) FPGA
board that sells for <200€. This board is based on the [Lattice
ECP5](https://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/ECP5) FPGA,
which has a complete open source toolchain and spares me the horrors
of dealing with proprietary FPGA toolchains. Go ♡♡♡♡ yourself, Xilinx.

The ULX3S allowed me to experiment with different RISC-V SOCs, such as
[LiteX](https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv) and
[SaxonSoc](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SaxonSoc). SaxonSoc has
excellent support for the ULX3S and supports everything from HDMI to
audio output. The [ULX3S community](https://gitter.im/ulx3s/Lobby)
(available on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) as
`#ulx3s_Lobby:gitter.im`) was extremely helpful in getting me
going. Prebuilt SaxonSoc bitstreams are available
[here](https://github.com/ulx3s/ulx3s-saxonsoc).

If you follow the
[instructions](https://github.com/lawrie/saxonsoc-ulx3s-bin/blob/master/linux/u-boot/README.md),
you get a setup with the [OpenSBI](https://github.com/riscv/opensbi)
firmware and the [U-Boot](https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot)
bootloader. Running Linux is a good way to check whether everything is
set up correctly.

## Fast Edit-Compile-Run

The diagram below outlines what my development setup ended up looking
like after some iterations.

![](/assets/2020-12-30-devsetup.png)

The ULX3S comes with an [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32)
that can connect to Wi-Fi and has access to the SD-Card on the
board. It can also flash new bitstreams for the FPGA, if
necessary. The ESP32 runs MicroPython and can be configured to serve
the SD-Card content via FTP. I use this to push new kernel images to
the card.

For debugging and logging, I use the built-in USB-serial adapter of
the ULX3S via [fujprog](https://github.com/kost/fujprog). Serial can
connect to either the FPGA or the ESP32. I keep serial connected to
the FPGA most of the time. For interacting and initially configuring
the ESP32, a [passthrough
bitstream](https://github.com/emard/ulx3s-bin/tree/master/fpga/passthru)
needs to be loaded to route serial to the ESP32 instead of the
FPGA. This can also be done via `fujprog`:

```sh
# This lasts till the board is power-cycled.
% fujprog -j sram < ulx3s_85f_passthru.bit
```

I configured the ESP32 to [connect to my
Wi-Fi](https://github.com/emard/esp32ecp5#connect-esp32-to-wifi). I
then push my binary with this Python script to the board:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i python3 -p python3

import sys

IP=sys.argv[1]
FILE=sys.argv[2]

from ftplib import FTP

ftp = FTP(IP)
ftp.set_debuglevel(1)
ftp.set_pasv(False)
ftp.login()

# Ask the ESP to mount the SD card as /sd.
ftp.sendcmd("SITE mount")

try:
    with open(FILE, 'rb') as f:
        ftp.storbinary("STOR /sd/epoxy.elf", f)
finally:
    # Clean up so U-Boot can access the card as well.
    ftp.sendcmd("SITE umount")
```


I copy my kernel as `epoxy.elf` onto the SD card. Then I configure
U-Boot to automatically boot it on power-up via the following commands
in the U-Boot shell:

```sh
# You might want to remember your old bootcmd.
=> printenv
...
=> set bootcmd "load mmc 0:1 0x80000000 epoxy.elf;  bootelf -p 0x80000000"
=> saveenv
```

`mmc 0:1` is the SD card device and `0x80000000` is an arbitrary free
memory location. Be sure to avoid putting the ELF file to a location
that is used by the ELF itself. Check the `PhysAddr` column of
`readelf -l` to see where it is going to be unpacked to. To find free
memory, you can look into the device tree that came with the
precompiled Linux using `dtc` or just check what memory Linux declared
as usable in `dmesg`.

The ESP32 comes up with the default hostname `espressif`. Pushing the
binary and watching the binary boot via serial, looks like this:

<!-- 
  Use this for a non-JavaScript player:
  ![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/381856.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/381856)
-->
<script id="asciicast-381856" src="https://asciinema.org/a/381856.js" async></script>

The whole workflow has a turnaround time of few seconds from editing
code to running the binary on hardware and I'm pretty happy with it. I
haven't covered how I actually build these ELF files, but this will be
a topic for a future blog post.
